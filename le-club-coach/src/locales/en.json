			"Q37": {
				"answer": "Image rights can be invoked when you film matches for public viewing. In this case, we recommend that you add a mention on image rights when registering players.",
				"imageRight": {
					"explanation_n1": "The person must be identifiable and recognizable on the offending publication. In the absence of identification, there can be no infringement of the right to the image.",
					"explanation_n2": "Image rights cannot be infringed without public use of this image. Indeed, if the image is not broadcast, it will not be possible to invoke the right to the image",
					"explanation_n3": "It is therefore quite difficult for an average spectator to easily recognize a player. In addition, several arguments seem to go against the principle of image rights",
					"explanation_n4": "you film the public domain",
					"explanation_n5": "you film a group",
					"explanation_n6": "people are difficult to identify (you are able to identify them because you know them and know their position / number on the match)",
					"explanation_n7": "Image rights are an interpretation of article 9 of the civil code, which means that the court is free to interpret this article as it sees fit.",
					"explanation_n8": [

						"the Gonesse District Court (Val d'Oise) dismissed on 24 July 2014 a complainant who wanted her photo, taken on the public highway by a local photo club, to be removed from a work distributed by the town hall to support its success in terms of social mix.",
						"The principles of previous case law continue to apply fairly regularly. The decision is moreover very broadly written, since \"the freedom to take a picture of a person on the public highway is reaffirmed\".",
						"The reservation relating to the dignity of the person is however reaffirmed, but it was not accepted against the defendant by the court in the present case, the complainant not being moreover the main subject of the photo (TI Gonesse RG no 11-13-000736)"
					],
					"more": "Some additional articles",
					"title": "To be in the presence of a case of damage to the image of a person, it would be necessary that"
				},
				"question": "What about image rights ?"
			},
			"Q4": {
				"answer": [
					"We work with many professional and amateur clubs. Le Havre, Quevilly Rouen, Marignane Gignac, Pays d´Aix, Montrouge FC, AAS Sarcelles, etc.",

					"We also work with many scouts from professional clubs to facilitate the relationship between professional and amateur clubs and players' tracking."
				],
				"question": "What are your references?"
			},
			"Q5": {
				"answer": [
					"Video is evrywhere in the professional world.",
					"It is a training and progression tool.",
					"By filming your team, you will analyze your game, correct your weaknesses, improve your strengths and understand what you have to work for the following week.",
					"The video saves weeks of work for many players on essential concepts on the individual level (positioning of the body, orientation of control, etc.) and collective (defend by advancing, play the offside, create numerical advantage, etc.)",
					"In addition, the video allows you to highlight the club when you share the best actions or the best games on your social networks!",
					"Last thing, professional clubs are very demanding of videos for tracking players, it is the best possible investment to develop a partnership with one or more professional club(s)!"
				],
				"question": "Why filming ?"
			},

				"answer_first_part": "LECLUB supports clubs in",

			"Q9": {
				"answer": "When you subscribe to a COACH or CLUB plan, a 6-meter pole, a camera, a battery, and rain protection are available to you for the duration of your subscription. During your subscription, the material is at home and you are responsible for the material. At the end of your subscription, you can either extend your subscription, or end it and send the equipment back to us. Return costs are your responsibility.",
